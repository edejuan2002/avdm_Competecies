# AVDM Project: Competencies

This project consists on analyzing the ``Competències Bàsiques'' data set in depth, with the aim of understanding the educational features of todays catalan pupils. Thus, we divide the work into four different parts, and each one tries to look for one specific feature.

The project relies on these open dataset repositories:
* Primary school: https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/d/rk5x-gny6
* Secondary school: https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/d/59vm-wwq7\\
* Investment: https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/d/8spq-9nx7\\
* Geography: https://www.icgc.cat/ca/Geoinformacio-i-mapes/Dades-i-productes/Geoinformacio-cartografica/Divisions-administratives

The question this part tries to solve is whether we can find any correlation between the educational attainment of private schools and the investment per pupil.

In the ``Ed_approach.ipynb'', we first show that studying private schools is representative of a significant proportion of catalan pupils. Then we show that there is no correlation between investment per pupil and educational attainment in the private schools.

Other jupyter notebooks are used to get introduced to plots and maps.
