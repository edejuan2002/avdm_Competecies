# AVDM Project: Competències Bàsiques

This project consists on analyzing the "Competències Bàsiques" data set in depth, with the aim of understanding the educational features of todays catalan pupils by studying the results of the different years final primary school and secondary school exams, also known as "Competències Bàsiques". Thus, we divide the work into four different parts, depicting four specific features of the chosen data set: the grades time evolution, the relation of every single student grades for different subjects, the relation between grades and finantial investment and the effects of promoting cultural events in the students results.

The project relies on these open dataset repositories:
* Primary school: https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/d/rk5x-gny6
* Secondary school: [https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/d/59vm-wwq7\\]
* Investment: [https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/d/8spq-9nx7\\]
* Cultural events: https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/Cultura-oci/Agenda-cultural-de-Catalunya-per-localitzacions-/rhpv-yr4f
* Geography: https://www.icgc.cat/ca/Geoinformacio-i-mapes/Dades-i-productes/Geoinformacio-cartografica/Divisions-administratives

## Temporal evolution
For both, the final secondary and final primary school exams, the average grades of every year students have been analyzed obtaining the time evolution for every.

The question this part tries to solve is whether we can find any correlation between the educational attainment of private schools and the investment per pupil.

In the ``Ed_approach.ipynb'', we first show that studying private schools is representative of a significant proportion of catalan pupils. Then we show that there is no correlation between investment per pupil and educational attainment in the private schools.

Other jupyter notebooks are used to get introduced to plots and maps.

In "Cultura.ipynb" we try to obtain a relationship between the number of cultural events in Catalonia during the period of 2018-2023 and the results in "Competències Bàsiques". 

To do so, we firstly represent, by type, the number of events held each year. Due to a lack of information between 2018-2020, we center our analysis in the gap 2021-2023. In search of a linear behaviour, we represented  mean grades for both 6th Primary School and 4t Seconday School tests results of some subjects with the number of cultural events of certain type. The criteria for the pairing was the apparent relation between the former and the latter; for instance, we matched "Book" type events with the results in Catalan and Spanish. 
In this line, we also made graphics with the proportion of students with good grades (above 75) in a subject and the proportion of cultural events of a particular type by region. 

Because in the analyses we did not obtain a conclusive linear fit nor a similar behaviour in the decayment, respectively,  we  concluded that cultural events and performance in Competències bàsiques are not correlated.
